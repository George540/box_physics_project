1. PROJECT CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING DELIVERABLES:
- Project proposal (sent in the beginning of the semester)
- Demo project excutable (access through: ../Rigidbody_Simulation_Project/Lab_Framework/BoxPhysicsEngine-Release.exe) Only works from there due to dependencies
- Project Source code with .sln workspace and all dependencies included INSIDE the folder
- HTML web page with image sources
- Project Report (11 pages)

2. THE PROJECT USED THE FOLLOWING TOOLS
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2019
- C++ standard library, iostream, vector
- OpenGL library 3.3 and 2.1 versions(2.1 used for Intel GPU): glfw, glm, gtc
- Blender3D v2.92 for exporting: cube.obj and sphere.obj
- Photoshop: editing box images

3. INSTRUCTIONS FOR USERS WHEN RUNNING EXECUTABLE:
- Enter 0 for Earth gravity, 1 for Moon
- Enter 0 for NOT testing sleeping stat, 1 otherwise
- WASD: camera movement
- Mouse cursor: camera rotation and lookAt
- Left mouse button: when looking at crate, hold left click to apply force
- Note: sometimes camera clamps at the opposite direction. Rotate camera to return to original view
